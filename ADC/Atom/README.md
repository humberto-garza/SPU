Compilation
===================
To copile the main.cpp file just execute this command:

```
g++ main.cpp -lmraa -L../usr/lib/
```
This command will create an executable program called "a.out" (default executable target name).
You can change it if you want, follow this [reference](http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~jestes/howto/g++compiling.txt) for more information.
